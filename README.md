#Core Plot in Swift

I like programs that display information graphically. I keep wanting to be able to present charted information in my own programs. Core-Plot looks to be the best open source, Cocoa based charting library available. However whenever I try to use it I get bogged down trying to figure out how to get even basic charts to work. 

This project is my attempt to experiment with the framework, make some sense of it and record that information for later.

## Real Time Example
I have a stream of data coming in. I want to display that in the app.
- How do I get the basic chart in place?
- Can a theme be used and re-used in other projects?
- How do I scroll the graph so that all the data is always in view
- How can I scroll the chart so that a fixed times worth of data is shown (e.g., a scrolling window)
- Many more questions
